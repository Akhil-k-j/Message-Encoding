# Message-Encoding
Hi all, 
In this project, I've crafted a cutting-edge C program that harnesses steganography to embed confidential messages seamlessly within BMP images. By strategically manipulating the least significant bit (LSB), this tool enables covert communication while preserving the integrity of the visual data. 🎨🔑
Powered by intricate bitwise operations, the encoded message remains concealed within the image, offering a robust solution for secure data transmission. 💻🔍

Run this program after compilation by: 
for encoding: ./a.out -e beautiful.bmp secret.txt
for decoding: ./a.out -d stego.bmp output.txt
